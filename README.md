üöß In the early 2000s, I was constantly building PHPBB and Invision PowerBoard forums. I even helped build Geocities and MySpace pages for friends. In highschool, I took a web development class that taught me the basics of HTML and CSS. At the time I didn't realize that I had a passion for building websites and contributing to online communities!

‚öôÔ∏è I've had an exciting career exploring various roles to find my path. I've worked as a line cook and sous chef in restaurants, a shift leader in manufacturing plants, and a sales associate at Costco. Throughout these experiences, I developed skills in leadership, agile methodology, persistence, and being the best support to my team that I can be.

üìà Through my work experience, I've learned to adapt quickly, as each day brings new opportunities. To ensure a successful day, I support my team and develop plans through effective communication. Driven by a sense of urgency and a pursuit of perfection, I apply the skills I've honed in cooking to achieve goals that lead to team success.

üíª The challenges of coding provide me with a deep sense of fulfillment. I enjoy the process of identifying issues, fixing them, and improving the system. The satisfaction of fixing a bug or developing a new feature gives me a feel of satisfaction and helps keep me motivated.
