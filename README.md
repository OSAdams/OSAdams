### Hello World! I'm [Owen Adams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1448XPszcnDVur_EXn1Vn_s7Uvi_VTqeH/view?usp=sharing)! I'm taking a leep into the Tech Industry!

üöß In the early 2000s, I was constantly building PHPBB and Invision PowerBoard forums. I took a web development class that taught me the basics of HTML and CSS. Geocities and heavily modified MySpace pages were popular at the time. Little did I know, I had a passion for coding as I was building things for fun in my free time.

‚öôÔ∏è I've had an exciting career exploring various roles to find my path. I've worked as a line cook and sous chef in restaurants, a shift leader in manufacturing plants, and a sales associate at Costco. Throughout these experiences, I developed skills in leadership, agile methodology, setting goals, and building customer relations to drive revenue growth for the businesses I worked with.

üìà Through my work experience, I've learned to adapt quickly, as each day brings new opportunities. To ensure a successful day, I support my team and develop plans through effective communication with multiple departments. Driven by a sense of urgency and a pursuit of perfection, I apply the skills I've honed in cooking to achieve goals that lead to repeat business and satisfied customers.

üíª The challenges of coding provide me with a deep sense of fulfillment. I enjoy the process of identifying issues, fixing them, and improving the system. The satisfaction of solving a bug or developing a new feature gives me a rush of dopamine and keeps me motivated every single day.

Lets connect and build something!
