### Hello World! I'm [Owen Adams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_dgwyE2ISifXam5gFcGap2TC9nSBDMoK/view?usp=sharing), a passionate individual who is changing careers to the Tech Industry!

üöÄ With a real world work environment at LearningFuze, I have learned how to build websites. The challenge of coding has drawn me in, almost like an addiction. I want to find a solution to a problem, and improve that solution. That is my favorite thing about coding, there's multiple approaches to a solution. With this abundance of knowledge, you can only improve and grow.

üß† With my career in hospitality, I've learned how to work with urgency and accuracy. I do not want to make mistakes, but I am not afraid to make them. I firmly believe mistakes are the best opportunities to learn. With learning comes accuracy, speed, and knowledge. Every day will present an opportunity to learn something new. I'm looking for it.

üë®‚Äçüè≠ Being a leader in Restaurants taught me how to be adaptive to unplanned situations. These experiences have provided me the knowledge on being able to communicate effectively with multiple teams. My curiousity for wanting to understand complex technical matters helps me create a digestible explanation for a common goal

Let's connect and build together!
