I am currently located in the Oakland County area in Michigan. 

I'm currently a freelancer with experience in JavaScript, PHP, & React. ^(stack expanded below)

Throughout my life, I have always been more interested in technology than anything else. Unfortunately, it took my stubborn self many years to realize what challenges I gravitate too. Building applications and understanding logic allows me to define functions and declare variables that allow a user to post a comment. It sounds boring, and it can be. However, you can break an application. You get frustrated. Some times it's a simple miss-type of a variable name. Sometimes it's a journey to learning more than what you sought for. 

During 2020, I decided I wanted to get into programming. Indirectly, I participated in an 'Intro to Website Development' course in highschool (crica 2007 - HTML & CSS!), modified sites like geocities and myspace, and even styled web forums with phpbb and Invision Powerboards! 

In many cases, it helps improve your ability to plan building, and debugging features in applications! I love it!

Aside from building applications, my current hobbies are disc golfing, gardening, and cooking.
